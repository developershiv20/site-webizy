File-types

Full Color- The standard variation in full color is probably be the most used variation as well. 

Monotone- The final color variation is monotone — both all black and all white.These won’t be used as often as   
                  the full color variations, but it’s important to have copies of these on hand regardless. If you’re using  
                  your logo in a very simplified context — like on a black & white fax printout, or cut into a steel sign —                   these monotone copies will offer the versatility needed to accomplish that.

CMKY - CMYK is used for high quality print products.
